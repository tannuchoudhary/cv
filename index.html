    <!--i.e all the texts inside our web page should be encoded in utf-8 (so that it should be randed correctly)-->

    <!--utf-8 is the standard encoding which includes all the international symbols which prevents the browser to mess up the letters -->

    <title>Tannu's Personal Site</title>
    <!--This tells the browser that what would be the title of this particular page -->
    <!-- we can define css code in 3 ways, inline, internal and external-->
    <!-- inline would be definining inside the body, this will just effect the page in which you are defining -->
    <!-- internal would effect the entire webpage, it have to be defined in head-->
    <!-- you just have to write the name on which you want to implement this css code, for e.g if you want to
    effect the body then write body under style and then write the whole style code -->

    <!-- external - if you want to change the style of all web pages of you website then you have to define css externally
    i.e create another file with css extension and link it with html like this-->
    <!-- if your website is of 200 pages, then it is not good idea to define it inline or internally-->


   <!-- Just type link and press enter, you'll see this  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/master.css">
    when browser will reach this line moving from the top, it will understand that you want to implement <style media="screen">
    to your website and then it will go to that location which you have mentioned
    but the problem here is that the first backward slash is telling the web to look in the root folder but in actul
    our file is in css folder so remove that backward slash and then you are good to go
    web will search in the same folder in which the html file is i.e  html personal site in my case
    and then will go to folder css and then will acess the file style.css -->

   <!-- now apply this link to hobbie and cotact me page also-->

   <!-- the order of priority is
   Inline css
   Internal css
   External css

   if you will set color using all three properties then priority will be given to inline and
   the design of the website will be according to what designes in inline, everything else will
   be overwritten -->

   <!-- using this you can apply global css using external css and if you want to change the design
   of any particular page differently then use inline or internal, it will effect that page only leaving the rst of the pages-->
